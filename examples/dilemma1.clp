;;;======================================================
;;;   Farmer's Dilemma Problem
;;;
;;;     Another classic AI problem (cannibals and the 
;;;     missionary) in agricultural terms. The point is
;;;     to get the farmer, the fox the cabbage and the
;;;     goat across a stream.
;;;        But the boat only holds 2 items. If left 
;;;     alone with the goat, the fox will eat it. If
;;;     left alone with the cabbage, the goat will eat
;;;     it.
;;;        This example uses rules and fact pattern 
;;;     matching to solve the problem.
;;;
;;;     CLIPS Version 6.4 Example
;;;
;;;     To execute, merely load, reset and run.
