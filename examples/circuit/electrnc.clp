;;;======================================================
;;;   Circuit Input/Output Simplification Expert System
;;;
;;;     This program simplifies the boolean decision 
;;;     table for a circuit consisting of inputs (SOURCES) 
;;;     and outputs (LEDs). 
;;;
;;;     The simplification procedure works as follows:
;;;     1) The connections between components of the
;;;        circuit are initialized.
;;;     2) The response of the circuit when all SOURCEs
;;;        are set to zero is determined.
;;;     3) Source input values are changed one at a time
;;;        and the response of the circuit is determined.
;;;        All possible input combinations are iterated
;;;        through using a gray code (a number representation
;;;        system using binary digits in which successive
;;;        integers differ by exactly one binary digit).
;;;        For example, the gray code for the numbers 0 to 7
;;;        is 0 = 000, 1 = 001, 2 = 011, 3 = 010, 4 = 110,
;;;        5 = 111, 6 = 101, 7 = 100. By using a gray code,
;;;        only one SOURCE has to be changed at a time to
;;;        determine the next response in the decision 
;;;        table (minimizing execution time).
;;;     4) As responses are determined, a rule checks to
;;;        see if any two sets of inputs with the same
;;;        response differ if a single input. If so, then
;;;        the single input can be replaced with a * 
;;;        (indicating that it does not matter what the
;;;        value of the input is given the other inputs).
;;;        For example,  if the input 0 1 0 gave a response
;;;        of 1 0 and the input 0 0 0 gave the same response,
;;;        then the decision table can be simplified by
;;;        indicating that 0 * 0 gives a response of 1 0.
;;;     5) Once all responses and simplifications have been
;;;        determined, the decision table for the circuit is
;;;        printed.
;;;        
;;;     This example illustrates the use of most of the
;;;     constructs available in CLIPS 6.0 and also shows how
;;;     COOL can be effectively integrated with rules.
;;;     Generic functions are used to connect the components
;;;     of the circuit during initialization. Classes,
;;;     message-handlers, and deffunctions are used to
;;;     determine the response of the circuit to a set of
;;;     inputs. Rules, deffunctions, and global variables
;;;     are used to control execution, iterate through all
;;;     possible input combinations, simplify the boolean
;;;     decision tree, and print out the simplified decision
;;;     tree.
;;;
;;;     CLIPS Version 6.4 Example
;;; 
;;;     To execute, load this file, load one of the circuit
;;;     files (circuit1.clp, circuit2.clp, or circuit3.clp), 
;;;     reset, and run.
